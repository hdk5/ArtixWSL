# ArtixWSL
Artix Linux on WSL (Windows 10 FCU or later) based on [wsldl](https://github.com/yuk7/wsldl) and inspired by [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL)

Refer to [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL) README for further instructions - most of it should also work for ArtixWSL

Note that this project is not affiliated with neither ArchWSL, Artix, nor any of these projects maintainers - bothering them with questions regarding ArtixWSL would make you look stupid and make them mad at both you and me.
